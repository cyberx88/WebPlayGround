Knockout usses a Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM) pattern

Viewmodel: contains scripts
View: contains html code

data-bind: let you associate the viewmodel with the DOM elements

observables: 	properties that automatically notify when the value
				is changed. It updates the view with new data.
				
computed properties: observables that are based on values of other observables
