Knockout usses a Model-View-ViewModel(MVVM) pattern

Viewmodel: 				contains scripts
View: 					contains html code

data-bind: 				let you associate the viewmodel with the DOM elements

observables: 			properties that automatically notify when the value
						is changed. It updates the view with new data.
				
computed properties: 	observables that are based on values of other observables

						this.fullName = ko.computed(function(){
							return this.firstName() + " " + this.lastName();
						}, this);

read/write observable: 	call it as a function 

						this.capitalizeLastName = function(){
							var currentVal = this.lastName();
							this.lastName(currentVal.toUpperCase());
						}
						
observable in the view:	observables are written as a function in the view

root prefix:			$root. prefix causes in Knockout to look for a handler on the top-level
						viewmodel
